# PortFolioMovieApp

API KEY is declared in the string.xml file / launching the app without an api key from theMoviedb.org will cause it to crash

The Retrofit implementation needs to be reworked, the interface and calls work just fine, but in this code i create multiple instances of the service and that isn't optimal.
